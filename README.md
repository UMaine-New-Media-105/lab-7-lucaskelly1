For this Lab, we created a diagonal pattern of random colored rectangles. We made it random colored using a let function. Then we were to use increments to create a grid of the shape, and make a gradient based on where the mouse is. Unfortunatly, I didn't have enough time to achieve a grid or gradient, but I did learn how to use someVar.
